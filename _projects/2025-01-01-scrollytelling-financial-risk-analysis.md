# Abstract 

This article attempts a concise financial risk analysis of top semiconductor industry stocks, leveraging unique models such as the multivariate orthogonal GARCH (OGARCH) model, Value-at-Risk (VaR) and volatility metrics, powered by Yahoo finance data. The article also explores critical factors influencing investment decisions, emphasizing the importance of accounting for unseen volatility events. This article provides readers with an understanding of how these fluctuations impact stock performance and understand that volatility is essential for making informed investment choices in this sector.

# Brief Description 

The following stocks are examined in a stock portfolio: Qualcomm (QCOM), Broadcom Inc. (AVGO), Micron Technology, Inc. (MU), Texas Instruments Incorporated (TXN), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD), and NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA). The historical daily returns are log-transformed for each stock and analyzed to identify periods of varying volatility sizes during the sampled period (January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2023). The multivariate orthogonal GARCH (O-GARCH) model is applied using principal component factors to identify key drivers affecting these components and compute a conditional variance matrix for each period.

Additionally, a 1% value-at-risk model (VaR) model is calculated to examine the long position of $1 million on the stock portfolio for the next trading day. The reliability of the VaR model is further assessed using a backtesting framework to validate its effectiveness in forecasting risks.

# Financial Risk Analysis of Semiconductor Stocks using O-GARCH and Value-at-Risk (VaR) Models

## Project Description
This project presents a financial risk analysis of selected semiconductor manufacturing stocks by examining their asset volatility through advanced econometric models. Utilizing R, specifically the O-GARCH (Orthogonal Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) and Value-at-Risk (VaR) models, this study evaluates the risk and volatility of investments within the semiconductor sector. Findings are visually and interactively presented through a custom personal website, built with the `qmd-lab/closeread` R package, HTML, and CSS.

## Motivation
Understanding the dynamics of financial volatility is essential for assessing portfolio risk and making informed investment decisions. The semiconductor industry, due to its sensitivity to innovation cycles and global supply chains, presents a compelling case for volatility modeling.

***

## Problem Statement
How can investors assess the volatility and risk associated with semiconductor stocks over time? What models best capture the true underlying risk of these assets, given the fact that volatility is not directly observable?

***

## Data Description
- **Stocks Analyzed:** Qualcomm (QCOM), Broadcom (AVGO), Micron Technology (MU), Texas Instruments (TXN), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), NVIDIA (NVDA)
- **Source:** Yahoo Finance
- **Time Period:** January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2023
- **Data Type:** Adjusted closing prices, converted to daily and monthly log returns

***

## Methodology
1. **Log Returns Calculation:** Asset prices were transformed into daily and monthly log returns to allow for consistent volatility modeling.  
2. **Exploratory Analysis:** Visual inspection of returns, outliers, and summary statistics.  
3. **Univariate and Multivariate Models:**
   * ARCH, GARCH for basic volatility estimates  
   * O-GARCH (1,1) model using principal component analysis (PCA)  
4. **Value-at-Risk Estimation:**
   * Empirical quantile method  
   * Parametric O-GARCH model  
5. **Backtesting:** Rolling window approach to evaluate model accuracy over time  

***

## Key Findings
1. **Volatility & Return Profiles:**
  * AMD and NVIDIA show high volatility and extreme returns, often tied to market events like CPU/GPU launches and the AI boom.
  * Texas Instruments has the lowest volatility, offering a more stable investment profile.

2. **Statistical Highlights:**
  * **Highest Avg Return:** NVIDIA  
  * **Highest Volatility:** AMD  
  * **Most Outliers (High Kurtosis):** AMD, Qualcomm  
  * **Negative Skew (Extreme Losses):** Broadcom  

3. **Correlation Insights:**
  * Strong correlations between TXN, AVGO, and QCOM
  * AMD and QCOM show lower correlation â†’ better diversification

4. **O-GARCH Findings:**
  * 3 Principal Components explain over 85% of return variation
    * PC1 = Market Factor 
    * PC2 = Financial Factor 
    * PC3 = Emerging Tech/Metaverse

5. **Value-at-Risk (VaR):**
  * Estimated VaR at 95% confidence for $1M = ~$25,946 to $44,449
  * Backtesting showed good fit in normal times, underperformance in stress periods like COVID-19
