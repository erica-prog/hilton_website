# Full Description 

The following stocks are examined in a stock portfolio: Qualcomm (QCOM), Broadcom Inc. (AVGO), Micron Technology, Inc. (MU), Texas Instruments Incorporated (TXN), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD), and NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA). The historical daily returns are log-transformed for each stock and analyzed to identify periods of varying volatility sizes during the sampled period (January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2023). The multivariate orthogonal GARCH (O-GARCH) model is applied using principal component factors to identify key drivers affecting these components and compute a conditional variance matrix for each period.

Additionally, a 1% value-at-risk model (VaR) model is calculated to examine the long position of $1 million on the stock portfolio for the next trading day. The reliability of the VaR model is further assessed using a backtesting framework to validate its effectiveness in forecasting risks.
